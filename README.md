## 🧠 Object-Oriented Design

Built with key OOP principles:
- **Encapsulation**: All game elements (Plane, Meteor, Bullet) are managed via classes.
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: Enables modular, reusable, and dynamic behaviors.
- **Abstraction**: Clean separation between game logic, rendering, and event handling.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **GUI Framework**: Java Swing
- **Media**: GIF background, custom sprite images
